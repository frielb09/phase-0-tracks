# Pseudocode: 
# 	- First create a variable and give it a script value 
# 	- Next use the encrypt method on the script value
# 	- When encrypt method is assigned a script value, advance every letter of the string one letter forward.
# Pseudocode: Decrypt 
# 	- Use the decrypt method on a script value. 
# 	- When the decrypt method is assigned to a script value, move back every letter of the string.
