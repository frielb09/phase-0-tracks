# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version Control: It is software that keeps track of projects; it records the changes made so if you need to recall a specific version later, you can. It is useful because it allows you to revert back to a previous part or compare the changes that were made by different people on the project. It's easier also to find errors if any come up, being able to look back through the different additions that were made. You can save local versions of a project, creating additions to it and you can add your additions to a central version if you are collaborating on a project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branch: A branch is a "side feature" it allows you to work on a project but not affecting the original until you merge the files. You would want to use one to show your additions to the work on a project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is like a save point or a snapshot of the additions that you have made. This saved record can then be compared, shared or reverted to. It saves on the local repository and doesnt merge. 

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge Conflict: it is an issue when trying to merge files, typically occuring when competing line changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted.
