<!-- *Purpose of HTML5 Semantic tags: The purpose is for webpage design, semantics describes its meaning to the browser and the user. 
*Order of Browser:header, nav, section, article, aside, footer. 
*Sublime: sublime has a lot of tools that I'll have to explore but the snippets are a useful tool but something I'll have to practice building first. 
-My most challenging concept would be the flow and syntax for the HTML page. Practice will definitely help improve my understand and design of html.
